		<h3>Artificial Intelligence - Javascript</h3>
		<br />
		<p>This project is coded entirely in JavaScript, implemented through an HTML page. It is a graphical representation of a 
		car using artificial intelligence to determine if a light is green or not, and using that decision to determine whether or not to cross a busy
		intersection. The smart car uses the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to determine the state of the light at the intersection. The
		cross traffic is not using an AI algorithm, and is hard coded to simply go when they have a green light. This project helped
		solidify my JavaScript skills, as well as serving as my first implementation of artificial intelligence in my code.</p>

		<h3>Website Design Project</h3>
		<br />
		<p>This project is a website that I designed for a made-up company, Shelly's Squirrel Sanctuary. It utilizes elements of
		Java, JavaScipt, HTML, and Java Server Pages (jsp). This project uses bootstrap for most of the main elements of the site.
		The purpose of this website is to showcase my competency in web development, design,and implementation. Though fully functioning,
		this is one of my current ongoing projects, and I am currently working on connecting this website to a SQL database. </p>

		<h3>Breakout Game</h3>
		<br />
		<p>I coded this game with the help of a Mozilla tutorial and their API documentation. While I followed their tutorial,
			I modified the game to suit my preferences. Notably I altered the collision detection algorithm, color scheme, and difficulty
			of the game.
			<br />
			The game canvas and logic is coded entirely in Javascript, and embedded in a simple HTML page.

		<h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
		<br />
		<p>This program, written in Java, is a classic example of Conway's Game of Life. It is essentially a program which utilizes Javafx
			to create a game board initialized with a random number of cells alive. The game then goes through 100 iterations following the
			rules of Conway's game of life, which can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules">here.</a>
			<br />
			This project was my first time programming with javafx, and was a good way to cement my understanding of object oriented programming,
			since I was working mainly with classes and objects that I was unfamiliar with.

		<h3>Console-based MySQL Application</h3>
		<br />
		<p>This is a very basic program written in Java which is meant to demonstrate my competence in MySQL and databases in general.
			The database is designed to be implemented in the website I designed, titled Shelly's Squirrel Sanctuary. It holds
			records for customers' accounts, order history, store item and inventory information, and customer billing information.
			The program allows for a SHA encrypted user login, as well as basic maintenance functions of the database. This program 
			serves as a prototype for the implementation of this database into the website.
			<br />
			<br />
			The source code link below includes the sql query string to create the database with some test values, as well as the java program
			to interact with it. Also included is a url which is a link to a 3 minute video which demonstrates some of the app's usage by me.

		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<br />
		<p>The website you are currently browsing, my portfolio, is another example of my html coding style. I designed the website to 
			look clean and professional. This website is coded entirely in html, using bootstrap elements.
